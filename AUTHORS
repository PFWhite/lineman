# Lineman Authors

The RED-I Project would not be possible without the generous contributions of
our authors and contributors. Lineman is a tool that contributes to RED-I by
ensuring that all your JSON data will be REDCAP compliant.

David R Nelson and his HCV Target project and the University of Florida
Clinical Translational Science Institute for providing the seed funding
that launched the RED-I Project.
